# Advanced Automation at SSIS

From functions and state machines to data science and machine learning. See at [aa.ssis.edu.vn](https://sites.google.com/ssis.edu.vn/automation)

## Unit 1: [Functions and Modular Code](https://github.com/ssis-aa/functions-and-modular-code)

In 9 lessons we learn the basics of defining and calling functions, providing input parameters and return output values. And we define and describe the algorithms to solve our problems.
