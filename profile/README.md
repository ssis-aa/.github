# Advanced Automation at SSIS

From functions and state machines to data science and machine learning.

## Unit 1: [Functions and Modular Code](https://github.com/ssis-aa/functions-and-modular-code)

In 9 lessons we learn the basics of defining and calling functions, providing input parameters and return output values. And we define and describe the algorithms to solve our problems.

## Unit 2: [Managing State](https://github.com/ssis-aa/managing-state)

Convert a binary string into a readable ASCII text to learn more about abstraction and decomposition.

## Unit 3: [Collaborative code](collaborative-code)


## Unit 4: [Control Algorithms and APIs](control-algorithms-and-apis)


## Unit 5: [Machine Learning](machine-learning)


## Unit 6: [Measurement and Data Processing](measurement-and-data-processing)
